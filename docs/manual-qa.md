# Manual QA Checklist

This checklist covers behavior that unit tests cannot prove because it depends
on real Fcitx5 UI, application toolkit preedit handling, clipboard integration,
and display server behavior.

## Setup

- Install the current build:

  ```sh
  scripts/check.sh
  ARI_IME_BUILD_DIR=build bash scripts/install-local.sh
  ```

  For a system/package install, use the distribution package or
  `sudo cmake --install build` instead. The local helper is important when
  testing a `~/.local` build because Fcitx5 may otherwise keep loading the
  older system addon.

- Restart Fcitx5.
- For a clean-profile first-run check, use the installed helper:

  ```sh
  ari-ime-enable --make-default
  ```

  It must add Ari once, preserve a backup of an existing profile, and leave
  unrelated input-method entries intact. The graphical `fcitx5-configtool`
  path remains a supported alternative.
- Select it and verify that the running daemon uses it:

  ```sh
  fcitx5-remote -s ari-ime
  test "$(fcitx5-remote -n)" = ari-ime
  ```

- Test with a fresh learned dictionary when validating deterministic behavior:

  ```sh
  ARI_IME_DISABLE_AUTOLEARN=1 fcitx5 -r
  ```

- Candidate ordering comes from libchewing and may change across libchewing
  versions. When a scenario inserts `1j4`, validate caret placement and commit
  behavior using the current default ㄅㄨˋ candidate shown by your system.
- For a reproducible candidate report, run `ari-ime-dict candidates su3` or
  `ari-ime-dict candidates hk4g4`; include `ari-ime-dict info` with the report.

## Environment Matrix

Run the core scenarios in at least one app from each toolkit group:

| Group | Suggested apps | Done |
|-------|----------------|------|
| GTK | gedit, GNOME Text Editor, Firefox text field | [ ] |
| Qt | Kate, KWrite, Qt Creator text field | [ ] |
| Electron / Chromium | Chromium, VS Code, Discord text field | [ ] |

Run clipboard and candidate-click scenarios under both display servers when
available:

| Display server | Done |
|----------------|------|
| Wayland | [ ] |
| X11 | [ ] |

The current public-release audit also includes these recorded toolkit
smoke paths (they validate the Fcitx5 input-context protocol, preedit and
commit path; they do not replace the named-application and theme checks
below):

| Toolkit path | Display server | Result |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| GTK3 `GtkIMContext` preedit/commit harness | Wayland | Passed |
| Qt6 `QLineEdit` preedit/commit harness | X11 | Passed |
| VS Code Electron editor preedit/commit smoke | X11 | Passed |

If a release is tested on a different desktop session, rerun the matrix above
and record any application-specific behavior before publishing it.

## Core Input

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Mixed Chinese/English | Type `aceru/6aj4`, press Enter | Preedit shows `acer螢幕`; app receives `acer螢幕` only after Enter |
| Literal English | Type `README.md`, press Enter | Preedit and commit stay `README.md` |
| Tone-one result decision | On the default layout, type `a` then Space, `b` then Space, `u` then Space, and an out-of-order body such as `ia` then Space in fresh preedits | `a ` and `b ` stay literal; `u` + Space and valid Han-producing bodies such as `ia` become Chinese, based on actual conversion output rather than a key or word list |
| URL/version literal | Type `https://ari-ime.test/v1.1.0`, press Enter | Version digits and dots stay literal |
| Acronym + Chinese | Type `HTTPsu3`, press Enter | Preedit and commit are `HTTP你` |
| Forced English | Press Ctrl+Space, type `su3`, press Enter | Mode hint shows English; commit is `su3`; mode remains English |

## Candidate Window

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| No automatic candidate panel | Type `hk4g4` (`測試`) without pressing Down | Preedit shows `測試` and no candidate panel appears; the result still follows libchewing's contextual ranking |
| Normal typing stays uncluttered | Type `hk4g4su3` without pressing Down | Preedit becomes `測試你`; digits are never interpreted as candidate picks |
| Open candidates | Type `su3`, press Down | Candidate window opens on `你`; selected char is visually clear |
| Trailing phrase recommendation | Type `hk4g4` (`測試`), press Down at the end | The candidate list recommends `測試` before single-character `試` alternatives |
| Pick by number | With candidates open, press `2` | Candidate is applied; preedit updates; no premature commit |
| Pick by click/touch | Open candidates, click a visible candidate | Same result as number-key selection |
| Continue after pick | Re-pick a character in a long preedit, then type another syllable | Candidate mode closes and new text appends at the end without extra Right/End keys |
| Undo candidate choice | Pick two candidates, press Ctrl+Z twice | Each press restores one choice; after typing or deleting text, Ctrl+Z returns to the application |
| Forget personal candidate | Highlight a previously learned candidate, press Shift+Delete | A transient success hint appears; a fresh composition follows libchewing's ranking without that personal entry, while the candidate remains selectable from the base dictionary |
| Page candidates | Type `su3`, press Down, PageDown/PageUp | Candidate page changes; aux line shows page count |
| Raw key revert | Type `su3`, press Down, Shift+Tab or Up to `原始鍵 su3`, press Enter | Preedit becomes `su3` |
| Stale click resilience | Open candidates, rapidly page then click an old candidate position | Candidate window does not disappear unexpectedly |
| Committed-text reconversion | Commit `測試`, select the two Chinese characters in the application, press `Ctrl+Alt+R` | The selected text is replaced by an Ari preedit; native candidates include `測試` and a phrase alternative such as `策士` |
| Reconversion correction | While reconversion is active, choose a phrase candidate and press Enter | The original selected range is replaced by the chosen phrase; no extra Ari window is required |
| Reconversion cancel | Start reconversion, press Esc or change focus before committing | The original selected text is restored; no selected text is lost |
| Reconversion safety | Select text containing English, punctuation, more than 32 Chinese characters, or a password field | `Ctrl+Alt+R` is passed through and the application text remains unchanged |

## Caret Editing

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Insert before text | Type `su3cl3`, press Home, type `1j4` | The current default ㄅㄨˋ candidate appears before `你好`; caret remains after inserted char |
| Insert in middle | Type `su3cl3`, press Left, type `1j4` | The current default ㄅㄨˋ candidate appears between `你` and `好` |
| Delete right of caret | Type `su3cl3`, press Left, Delete | Preedit becomes `你` |
| Close candidates | Type `su3`, Down, Esc, type `1j4` | Candidate window closes; next input inserts at caret |
| Append after candidate selection | Type `su3cl3`, Down, Right, type `1j4` | Right leaves the final candidate and places the caret after `你好`; new text appends there |
| Long preedit position | Compose more than 30 characters, then use Home/Left/Right and open candidates | Auxiliary lines show nearby text plus `游標 n/N` or `選字 n/N` |
| Phrase navigation | Compose a Chinese phrase and mixed English words, then use Ctrl+Left/Ctrl+Right | Caret jumps by libchewing phrase intervals and English word boundaries; Ctrl+Shift+Arrow remains available to the application |
| Forced-English editing | Toggle forced English, compose literal text, then use arrows, Backspace and mid-string typing | Literal preedit can be edited normally and Up does not reinterpret it as Zhuyin |

## Clipboard

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Paste into empty preedit | Copy `ABC`, press Ctrl+V | Preedit becomes `ABC`; typing continues after paste |
| Paste at caret | Type `su3cl3`, press Left, copy `ABC`, press Ctrl+V | Preedit becomes `你ABC好` |
| Paste multiline | Copy text with tabs/newlines, press Ctrl+V | Control separators become visible spaces in one-line preedit |
| Shift+Insert | Copy `ABC`, press Shift+Insert | Same as Ctrl+V |
| Shift+KP_Insert | Copy `ABC`, press Shift+numeric-keypad Insert | Same as Ctrl+V |

## Numeric Keypad

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| NumLock digits | Press keypad `1`, `2`, `3` | Preedit is literal `123`; digits do not become tone keys |
| Keypad navigation | Type `su3cl3`, press keypad Home, type `1j4` | The current default ㄅㄨˋ candidate appears before `你好` |
| Keypad candidate paging | Type `su3`, keypad Down, keypad PageDown/PageUp | Candidate pages move like main keyboard keys |

## Configuration And Status

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Layout switch | Change keyboard layout in configtool while preedit is active | Preedit clears; transient keyboard-layout hint appears |
| Full-width punctuation toggle | Toggle full-width punctuation in configtool | Transient `標點 全形` / `標點 半形` hint appears |
| App shortcut passthrough | Press common app shortcuts such as Ctrl+. in VS Code or browser text fields | The app shortcut still works; Ari IME does not reserve a fixed punctuation toggle shortcut |
| Status line | Compose any non-empty preedit | Aux line shows 中/英, keyboard layout, punctuation mode |
| Space candidate compatibility | Enable `SpaceCandidateMode`, type `hk4g4`, press Space | Candidate window opens with `測試`; disable it and confirm the default Space behavior remains unchanged |
| Reconversion shortcut | In addon settings, clear or rebind `ReconversionKey` | The default `Ctrl+Alt+R` is no longer reserved when cleared; the replacement shortcut performs the same safe reconversion check |
| Literal punctuation | With full-width punctuation off, type `su3`, then `< > ?`; start a fresh preedit and type `API?` | Punctuation does not depend on language context: results are `你<>?` and `API?` |
| Full-width punctuation | Enable full-width punctuation; type `< > ? ( ) { } ! : \ ^ ' @ % + =` | Preedit uses Chinese punctuation forms, including `、`, `……`, and full-width symbols |
| Explicit Chinese punctuation | With full-width punctuation off, use the configured `ChinesePunctuationShortcut` (default Ctrl+Shift) with comma, period, slash and the apostrophe key (`'`) | Preedit adds `，。？、`; specifically the configured shortcut plus `'` produces `、`; set Alt+Shift in configtool and repeat to verify the alternative path |
| Alt corner quotes | In normal Chinese mode, press `Alt+[` and `Alt+]` | Preedit adds `「」`; modified forms such as `Ctrl+Alt+[` and `Shift+Alt+]` remain available to the application |
| Punctuation candidates | Type `[` or `]`, then press ↓ | The candidate window opens with the current form first and offers only outputs reachable from that physical key, including the base key, Shift form, Ari shortcut forms and Alt corner quotes such as `[`, `{`, `「`, `『`; unrelated symbols such as `!` or `【` are absent; number keys and click/touch work |
| Punctuation-looking 注音 candidates | Compose a valid Chinese syllable that uses `.` or `,`, then press ↓ | All native Chinese candidates appear first, followed by outputs reachable from each physical key (base, Shift and shortcut forms) and then the raw-key recovery entry; selecting punctuation replaces only that character |
| Mid-string Chinese punctuation | Compose `你好`, move the caret between the characters, then press Ctrl+Shift+comma | Preedit becomes `你，好` |
| Bopomofo punctuation keys | Enable full-width punctuation; type `xu,4` | `,` remains a Bopomofo final key, not `，` |

## Per-user Learning

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Learn a homophone | With learning enabled and fresh user data, type `su3`, choose `妳`, press Enter, then type `su3` again | `妳` becomes the default conversion on the next composition |
| Weak versus strong evidence | With fresh data, type and commit `su3cl3` three times unchanged; then choose and commit the phrase `妳好` once; type `su3cl3` again | The one explicit phrase choice outweighs the three accepted defaults and produces `妳好` |
| Automatic context | With fresh data, type `ji32k7`, then type `ql32k7dj94` in a fresh preedit | The same ㄉㄜ˙ reading follows context: `我的` and `跑得快` |
| Sensitive field | In a password/sensitive field, choose a non-default candidate and commit; repeat in a normal field | The sensitive choice is not learned; the normal-field choice still is |
| Auto-learning toggle | Disable `AutoLearn` in addon settings, choose and commit a candidate, then repeat in a normal field | The choice is not learned while disabled; re-enabling restores ordinary learning |
| Commit boundary | Choose a non-default candidate, then reset the input method before pressing Enter | The uncommitted choice is not learned |

## Personal Dictionary Command

| Scenario | Steps | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Inspect data | Run `ari-ime-dict info` | The active data directory, libchewing version and entry count are printed |
| Portable export | Run `ari-ime-dict export /tmp/ari-dictionary.tsv` | The file contains the Ari header and phrase/tab/canonical-Bopomofo entries |
| Safe import | Run `ari-ime-dict import --dry-run /tmp/ari-dictionary.tsv`, then import it | Dry-run changes nothing; import is idempotent and reports a backup when existing data is changed |
| Candidate diagnosis | Run `ari-ime-dict candidates su3` | The current preedit and candidate page are printed without changing the Fcitx5 session |

## Visual Checks

- Candidate highlight is visible in the active Fcitx5 theme.
- The selected preedit character is identifiable while reselecting candidates.
- Aux up/down text does not overlap the candidate list.
- Long candidate labels such as `原始鍵 su3` are readable.
- The installed app icon appears in the input method list.
