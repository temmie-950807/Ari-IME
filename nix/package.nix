    longDescription = ''
      Ari IME is a Fcitx5 input method for Traditional Chinese that lets you
      type Bopomofo and English together without switching modes. Every key
      first shows as itself; keys only become Chinese once they form a
      complete, toned Bopomofo syllable. Built on libchewing for conversion,
      phrasing and per-user learning.
