# Changelog

## 2.6.1 - 2026-08-23

Packaging and identity release for the Ari IME rename. Typing behavior is
unchanged.

- Replace the legacy internal identifier everywhere with `ari-ime`, including
  the Fcitx5 addon, input method descriptor, shared
  library, icon, helper commands, CMake targets, and release package names.
- Keep the KDE/Fcitx5 display name as `Ari IME`; only the machine-facing ID is
  `ari-ime`, so the installed input method is no longer presented under the
  old project folder name.
- Move Ari-owned user data and environment variables to the `ari-ime` names,
  and synchronize the native release and `@ari-ime/wasm` package at 2.6.1.
- Existing learned data from the previous user-data directory is not migrated
  automatically because the old identifier is intentionally removed.

## 2.6.0 - 2026-08-23

Hardening release from a full code audit of the engine, tooling, and
packaging scripts. Everyday typing behavior is unchanged apart from the
fixes below; the full regression suite passes.

- Recognize `s` as the Hsu-layout neutral-tone key: 輕聲 syllables now convert
  instead of falling through to literal English.
- Keep full-width punctuation conversion away from 注音 keys: keypad `/ - . ,`
  and invalid-syllable extension keys no longer emit stray Bopomofo glyphs
  under FullWidthPunctuation.
- Clear stale candidate lists when reinterpreting an English cell or exploding
  a character back to raw keys, preventing a phantom candidate window wired to
  an outdated cell from writing into the wrong place.
- Paste path now drops clipboard clusters that are not well-formed UTF-8 and
  folds C1 controls into separators instead of committing broken bytes.
- ZWJ no longer glues plain ASCII neighbors into one cluster; real emoji
  sequences are unaffected.
- Cached per-character readings are cleared on keyboard-layout changes so
  reconversion never re-feeds old readings through the new layout; reading
  cache eviction is now FIFO rather than an arbitrary unordered_map element.
- ari-ime-dict: reject non-canonical readings per line before an import
  touches the dictionary, tolerate a leading UTF-8 BOM, include the line
  number when libchewing rejects an entry, and write file exports through a
  temporary file so a failed export cannot truncate an existing destination.
- Scripts: resolve symlinked Fcitx5 profiles instead of overwriting the link,
  make reset backups collision-proof with pid-suffixed stamps and `mv -n`,
  verify the Debian download checksum before dpkg-deb inspects it, and keep
  check.sh temp files cleaned up on failure paths.
- WebAssembly core: catch-all guards at the C ABI boundary plus stricter key,
  modifier, and learning-state validation in the JS wrapper.

## 2.5.7 - 2026-08-22

- Add an opt-in `ShowPendingZhuyin` setting (off by default). While an
  incomplete 注音 syllable is pending, its Bopomofo symbols are shown in the
  auxiliary line above the caret; the hint disappears once the syllable
  converts, the input turns literal English, or candidate selection opens.
  Contributed by @HongyiHank.
- Clean up and complete the comments added with the pending-zhuyin hint.

## 2.5.6 - 2026-08-22

- Offer the full Chinese bracket family from the bracket keys: the `[` key
  candidate window now also lists 【 〔 《 〈 and the `]` key lists 】 〕 》 〉
  alongside 「 『 and their half/full-width forms, so title marks such as 《》
  are reachable without switching tools.

## 2.5.5 - 2026-08-22

- Add a Nix flake exposing `packages`, `overlays.default`, `nixosModules.default`
  and `homeManagerModules.default`. The modules append Ari to
  `i18n.inputMethod.fcitx5.addons` whenever Fcitx5 is the selected input method
  framework, so NixOS users install through declarative configuration instead of
  an install script. The package version is read from `CMakeLists.txt` at
  evaluation time so it cannot drift from the source tree.
- Add a GitHub Actions job that runs `nix flake check` on pushes and pull
  requests.

## 2.5.4 - 2026-08-21

- Build punctuation candidates from the same physical key, including its
  unshifted, Shift, Ctrl/Shift and Alt shortcut outputs.
- Keep unrelated punctuation out of literal and punctuation-looking 注音
  candidate windows while preserving native candidates first and raw-key
  recovery last.
- Keep the physical-key candidate mapping shared by the native and WebAssembly
  input cores.

## 2.5.3 - 2026-08-21

- Fix `Ctrl` and `Alt` punctuation shortcuts for unshifted punctuation-looking
  注音 keys such as `,`, so 大千 can produce `，` without losing its ordinary
  注音 behavior.
- Keep the shortcut correction in the shared native and WebAssembly input core.

## 2.5.2 - 2026-08-21

- Add candidate re-selection for literal punctuation, limiting the list to
  forms associated with the focused key instead of mixing unrelated symbols.
- Merge punctuation alternatives from punctuation-looking 注音 keys into the
  same Chinese candidate window, while keeping the native Chinese result first.
- Add `Alt+[` and `Alt+]` shortcuts for Chinese corner quotes, and keep the
  shared behavior available to the native and WebAssembly cores.

## 2.5.1 - 2026-08-20

- Remove the synchronous Ari preference scan from live composition and selection
  rebuilds. Normal typing now leaves candidate ordering to libchewing's
  contextual and learned-frequency model; the interactive candidate window is
  opened only by an explicit user action.
- Remove the automatic display-only recommendation panel. The pre-edit stays
  uncluttered until the user explicitly opens candidate selection with Down.
- Add the headless `@ari-ime/wasm` package under `wasm/`, with a C ABI,
  TypeScript/ESM wrapper, candidate/reconversion APIs, and host-controlled
  learning-state snapshots for browser or Node applications.
- Fix mixed English/注音 suffix detection when a lowercase English word is
  immediately followed by a valid toned syllable.

## 2.5.0 - 2026-08-17

- Add safe committed-text reconversion: select a short all-Chinese range in a
  compatible Fcitx5 application and press the configurable `ReconversionKey`
  (default `Ctrl+Alt+R`) to reopen native candidates without retyping.
- Preserve the selected text on Escape or focus reset, and pass the shortcut
  through unchanged for mixed, long, unsupported, or sensitive selections.
- Cache reverse readings per input context so repeated reconversion does not
  rescan libchewing's candidate table.

## 2.4.0 - 2026-08-16

- Make the temporary Chinese-punctuation shortcut a native Fcitx5 setting.
  The default remains `Ctrl+Shift`; users can select `Alt+Shift`, `Ctrl`,
  `Alt`, or disable the gesture when an application reserves the default.
- Add opt-in `SpaceCandidateMode` for users who expect Space to open candidates
  after a complete Chinese conversion; Ari's mixed-input default is unchanged.

## 2.3.7 - 2026-08-16

- Persist phrases explicitly selected during normal composition in Ari's
  preference sidecar, so deliberate choices survive a fresh input context and
  are promoted consistently across libchewing versions.
- Make `Shift+Delete` remove both the libchewing personal entry and Ari's
  preference marker, including when the marker was loaded only from the
  sidecar.
- Make `ari-ime-enable` start Fcitx5 in a graphical session when needed,
  reload the profile, select Ari, and fail clearly if the active input method
  cannot be verified.

## 2.3.6 - 2026-08-16

- Keep Ari's explicit/imported phrase preferences in a separate sidecar instead
  of treating every libchewing learned entry as an explicit preference.
- Prevent preference promotion from disturbing long pre-edit candidate windows
  on older libchewing releases such as 0.6.
- Include the preference sidecar in dictionary backups and learned-data resets.

## 2.3.5 - 2026-08-16

- Load personal phrase mappings when a libchewing context is created, before
  any pre-edit exists, so older libchewing releases cannot disturb long live
  candidate windows while enumerating them.
- Keep mappings added through Ari's API immediately available in the current
  context; mappings changed by another process take effect after restart.

## 2.3.4 - 2026-08-16

- Cache personal phrase mappings per libchewing context instead of enumerating
  them on every completed syllable.
- Skip empty-dictionary enumeration so long candidate windows remain stable on
  older libchewing releases.

## 2.3.3 - 2026-08-16

- Promote personal phrase mappings in Ari's live conversion, so explicit or
  imported choices remain first even on older libchewing builds whose frequency
  scorer ranks user phrases conservatively.
- Keep `ari-ime-dict candidates` aligned with the interactive input result.
- Add regression coverage for imported homophones, one-key tone-one mappings
  such as `y` → `資`, and the diagnostic tool's promoted preedit.

## 2.3.2 - 2026-08-16

- Make portable-dictionary regression coverage assert that imported mappings
  remain selectable across libchewing versions, rather than assuming they
  always replace the distribution's first candidate.

## 2.3.1 - 2026-08-16

- Keep `ari-ime-dict info` compatible with Ubuntu's libchewing 0.6 by using the
  CMake/pkg-config dependency version instead of a newer runtime API.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-08-16

- Add the package-installed `ari-ime-dict` command with `info`, `list`,
  `candidates`, `export`, `import`, and `backup` operations.
- Make personal phrase mappings portable as readable UTF-8 text using
  libchewing's canonical Unicode Bopomofo readings rather than a
  layout-specific key sequence.
- Make imports validate before changing data, merge idempotently, and preserve
  a timestamped backup of existing libchewing files.
- Add CTest coverage for dictionary export/import, candidate restoration,
  invalid-input rejection, backups, and installation of the new command.

## 2.2.3 - 2026-08-16

- Make the first-run Fcitx5 profile helper write the standard `GroupOrder`
  section, preserving existing group order and appending new groups without
  overwriting their indices.
- Add regression coverage for clean profiles, idempotent setup, backups, and
  multi-group ordering.

## 2.2.2 - 2026-08-15

- Added the explicitly invoked `ari-ime-enable` command for first-run Fcitx5
  setup. It adds Ari to the user's profile with a backup, preserves unrelated
  input methods, and can optionally make Ari the group default.
- Installed `ari-ime-reset-data` with binary packages so learned-data reset does
  not require a source checkout.
- Added profile-helper regression coverage to CTest and corrected the Ubuntu /
  Debian development dependency documentation.

## 2.2.1 - 2026-08-15

- Extend the live libchewing context window to 32 Chinese characters while
  preserving whole-preedit editing and long-string candidate re-selection.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-08-15

- Added an `AutoLearn` addon setting so users can keep the local personal
  dictionary unchanged without disabling candidate selection.
- Added the public-launch design and verification specification covering mixed
  input, candidate editing, privacy, packaging, and desktop compatibility.
- Made pasted Emoji grapheme clusters safe to move and delete as one unit,
  including CRLF paste normalization.
- Fixed the Fcitx5 addon descriptor to expose Ari's input method through its
  installed `ari-ime-im.conf` entry (`OnDemand=True`); Fcitx can now load the
  addon when Ari is selected instead of finding zero input methods.
- Added a native, display-only candidate preview for completed Chinese results;
  it shows contextual alternatives without taking numeric keys away from the
  next mixed 注音/English input.
- Hardened native candidate click handling so a delayed click from an older
  candidate page cannot select the same slot on a newer page.
- Added `scripts/install-local.sh` so a user-directory development install
  restarts Fcitx5 with the correct local addon path and verifies the loaded
  module instead of silently continuing to use an older system copy.

## 2.1.3 - 2026-08-14

- Candidate re-selection now keeps phrase recommendations that contain the
  focused character, including when opening candidates from the end of a word;
  Right can also move from the final candidate to the append position.

## 2.1.2 - 2026-08-14

- Made Space's tone-one decision consistently result-based for multi-key
  out-of-order syllables too; valid Han-producing sequences are no longer
  rejected merely because their raw letters resemble an English token.

## 2.1.1 - 2026-08-11

- Replaced the single-key tone-one input-category gate with an output-based
  decision: a key converts only when libchewing actually produces a Han
  character. The rule is covered across every supported keyboard layout, so
  literal keys such as `a` / `b` and valid conversions such as `u` -> `一` no
  longer depend on a hand-selected key list.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-08-11

- Added multi-level `Ctrl+Z` for recent candidate choices and `Shift+Delete` to
  forget only the highlighted personal dictionary entry.
- Prevented password and sensitive fields from writing per-user learning data.
- Added phrase-aware `Ctrl+Left` / `Ctrl+Right` navigation using libchewing's
  recognized intervals, with ordinary English word boundaries in mixed text.
- Enabled caret editing in forced-English mode and explicit `Ctrl+Shift`
  Chinese punctuation insertion at a mid-string caret.
- Made ordinary punctuation context-independent and half-width by default;
  `Ctrl+Shift` plus a punctuation key now requests the Chinese form explicitly,
  while the existing opt-in full-width mode remains available.
- Restored valid single-key tone-one syllables such as `u` + Space → `一`
  without regressing literal one-letter English tokens such as `a ` and `b `.
- Weighted unchanged conversions as weak positive learning evidence while
  giving explicit character and phrase selections roughly four times the
  learning weight plus a short local-context reinforcement pass.
- Restored libchewing's native conditional phrase scoring as the automatic
  context engine instead of overriding it with static first-candidate and
  sentence-specific correction rules.
- Added deterministic coverage for `我的` / `跑得快` contextual homophones and
  for one explicit phrase choice outweighing three unchanged commits.

## 2.0.3 - 2026-07-26

- Added an automated Arch x86_64 binary release pipeline that builds and tests
  each tag in a clean Arch container before publishing a stripped runtime
  archive and checksum to GitHub Releases.
- Enabled a `fcitx5-ari-ime-bin` AUR package with runtime dependencies only;
  source builds remain available directly from GitHub.

## 2.0.2 - 2026-07-26

- Optimized AUR build dependencies by relying on Arch's required `base-devel`
  environment instead of redundantly declaring `gcc` in `makedepends`.
- Kept runtime dependencies limited to Fcitx5, libchewing and the lightweight
  hicolor icon theme required by the installed input-method icon.

## 2.0.1 - 2026-07-26

- Added fully offline, high-confidence context correction for conversational
  homophones while preserving libchewing candidate restoration and learning.
- Added regression coverage for punctuation-to-Zhuyin boundaries such as
  `(hk4g4` -> `(測試` and contextual `你應該試試` conversion.
- Migrated legacy `userdict.dat` learning data non-destructively to
  libchewing 0.12's standard `chewing.dat` name and silenced expected
  first-run dictionary diagnostics.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-07-09

- Degraded gracefully when the libchewing engine fails to initialize: retry
  against the read-only system dictionary, otherwise fall back to plain-English
  passthrough (with a one-time hint) instead of silently swallowing keys.
- Added an optional, user-configurable `FullWidthPunctuationToggle` shortcut to
  flip full-width punctuation live; unset by default so no application shortcut
  is reserved.
- Added Ubuntu/Debian support: apt dependency documentation, a `debian/`
  packaging directory, and a native Ubuntu build/test/package CI workflow.
- Documented known limitations in `ISSUES.md` and extended the version
  consistency check to cover `debian/changelog`.
- Closed a test-isolation gap: `TempConfigHome` now also sandboxes `HOME`,
  `XDG_DATA_HOME`, and `CHEWING_USER_PATH`, since libchewing 0.12 resolves its
  learned dictionary through those rather than only the path passed to
  `chewing_new2`. Tests are now deterministic regardless of the developer's
  real day-to-day typing.
- Pinned libchewing's learned dictionary to Ari's own data directory via
  `CHEWING_USER_PATH` (set only while the context is built), so learning no
  longer lands in — and pollutes — the shared `$XDG_DATA_HOME/chewing`
  directory used by other libchewing input methods.
- `scripts/reset-user-data.sh` now also clears libchewing's learned files
  (`chewing.dat`, `chewing-deleted.dat`), lists every file it will remove, and
  gained `--include-shared` to optionally reset the shared chewing directory
  left behind by older builds.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-07-01

- Refined symbol-led Bopomofo handling so sequences such as `.3-3` can be
  recovered as valid Zhuyin without breaking punctuation-heavy literal input.
- Extended the `Up` reinterpretation path to handle symbol-led Zhuyin at word
  boundaries and after existing Chinese text.
- Improved candidate ranking to keep phrase-level Chinese context ahead of
  raw-key fallback when the surrounding text already forms a Chinese word.
- Added regression coverage for symbol-led reinterpretation, mixed
  Chinese-plus-symbol input, and phrase-preserving candidate order.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-29

- Promoted Ari IME to a 1.0.0 release with synchronized project, package, and
  addon version metadata.
- Improved candidate ranking with local context-aware heuristics layered on top
  of libchewing candidate pools.
- Reduced symbol-vs-Bopomofo ambiguity so punctuation-heavy input is less
  likely to produce awkward Chinese candidates.
- Added explicit user-data management utilities, including safe reset support
  for the learned user dictionary.
- Kept automated tests isolated from real user personalization data while
  preserving production auto-learning behavior.
- Added a dedicated user-data test suite covering reset behavior, base
  dictionary integrity, and restartable personalization.
- Made the auxiliary composition status line optional and disabled by default.
- Expanded regression coverage for technical literals, mid-string editing,
  punctuation behavior, and layout-specific symbol keys.
